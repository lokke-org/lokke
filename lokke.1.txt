NAME
       lokke - a Clojure dialect for Guile

SYNOPSIS
       lokke [help|--help|-h|-?]

       lokke -0

       lokke run [-l path] [-e expr] [-a func] [RUN_OPT ...] [-- arg ...]

       lok (--help|-h|-?)

       lok [-l path] [-e expr] [-a func] [RUN_OPT ...] [-- arg ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Lokke  is  a Clojure dialect for Guile, and may be invoked in two ways.
       lokke is the most general command, acting as specified  by  an  initial
       subcommand  argument (e.g.  run), while lok is a convenience for inter-
       active use, and behaves exactly as if lokke run had been  invoked  with
       the  same  arguments.   When  no  arguments are provided, both commands
       present an interactive Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) on the terminal, and
       the  run  subcommand  acts as if the final arguments had been -e '(clo-
       jure.main/repl)' whenever no other -l, -e, -a, -, or FILE arguments are
       given.

       Any  args will be available as *command-line-args* in Clojure, and must
       be delimited from the others by --.

       The -0 option allows lokke to act as a script interpreter in  a  flexi-
       ble,  portable  manner, given that the handling of #!  interpeter lines
       is not standardized across platforms.  See SCRIPT EVALUATION below  for
       additional information.

       Unless  otherwise specified, and unlike Guile, lokke sets Guile's *ran-
       dom-state*  at  startup  to  a  value   generated   by   Guile's   ran-
       dom-state-from-platform,  meaning  that  rand-int  values, for example,
       will usually differ across invocations.

       You can invoke lokke run ... -e guile.guile/%load-path or  lok  ...  -e
       guile.guile/%load-path  to  display  the Guile load path (including any
       dependencies) for a given invocation.

RUN_OPT
       -l, --load file
              Execute code in file.

       -e, --eval code
              Evaluate code, printing any values that are not nil or  unspeci-
              fied.

       -a, --apply some.ns/function
              Apply some.ns/function to the *command-line-args*.

       -      Execute any code provided on standard input.

       file   Execute code in file, which must not start with a dash (-).

       --seed sys
              Initialize   the   *random-state*   (which  affects  calls  like
              rand-int) at startup in a  platform-specific  way.  Insufficient
              for security-critical applications.

       --seed integer
              Initialize  the  *random-state* at startup using the given inte-
              ger.

       --no-seed
              Suppress the  default,  implicit  --seed sys  at  startup.   The
              rightmost seed related argument determines the startup behavior.

SCRIPT EVALUATION
       If,  and  only  if, you don't need to specify any additional arguments,
       you may begin your scripts like this:

              #!/path/to/lokke-0 -0 ;; -*-clojure-*-
              !#
              (prn :hello-world)
              ...

       When lokke executes the program, the content between the #!  !# pair is
       ignored as a block comment, just as with Guile itself.

       Whenever  you  do  need to specify additional arguments, you should not
       put them on the #!  line because the handling  of  additional  text  on
       that line varies from platform to platform.  Sometimes the remainder of
       the line becomes a single arrgument, sometimes it is  split  on  white-
       space, and (more rarely), sometimes part of the line is ignored.

       Accordingly, if you need to make adjustments, you may do something like
       this:

              #!/path/to/lokke-0 -0 ;; -*-clojure-*-
              ;; We're in a Guile preamble module defining a procedure for each
              ;; lokke subcommand.
              (apply run "-l" %0 "--" %&)
              !#

              ;; Place your Clojure code here, after the !#
              (prn :hello-world)
              ...

       This will behave exactly the same as the  previous  example.   When  no
       code  is provided in the block comment, lokke will act as if (apply run
       "-l" %0 "--" %&) had been specified, but you can of course  adjust  the
       run invocation to suit your needs, or provide something else entirely.

       Everything after the -0 and before the !# is executed as Scheme code by
       Guile in a module that has definitions for each of  the  lokke  subcom-
       mands.  Note that the code Guile executes will begin with the character
       immediately after the zero in -0 no matter what it is (i.e. even if  it
       is not whitespace).  The zero actually specifies a compatibility level,
       and for now zero is the only valid number.

       As you may have guessed, the preamble module binds  %0  to  the  script
       path  (like  $0 in POSIX shells), %& to a list of all of the subsequent
       command line arguments, and %1, %2, etc. to the elements of %&.

       At the moment lokke is not a binary executable.  If the system requires
       #!  interpreters  to  be binary executables, or if you'd like to locate
       lokke via the current PATH, you may be able to rely on env like this:

              #!/usr/bin/env lokke-0 -0
              ...

READLINE SUPPORT
       Assuming your guile was compiled with  readline  support,  it's  likely
       you'll  want  to add something like this to ~/.lokke_guile to enable it
       in the REPL:

              ;;; -*-scheme-*-
              (use-modules (ice-9 readline))
              (activate-readline)

ENVIRONMENT
       LOKKE_HISTORY
              Specifies the path  to  the  REPL  history  file.   Defaults  to
              $XDG_CACHE_HOME/lokke/history when XDG_CACHE_HOME is set, other-
              wise $HOME/.cache/lokke/history.
